# Description

HCDC True Site is an unofficial, open-source Uptime Status Checker dedicated to monitoring the availability of key [Holy Cross of Davao College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Cross_of_Davao_College) websites.

This project is written in [Svelte](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_getting_started) and uses [SvelteKit](https://joyofcode.xyz/what-is-sveltekit) as its meta-framework. It conducts routine checks by leveraging [proxy servers](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/proxy-server#:~:text=A%20proxy%20server%20is%20a,web%20pages%20they%20visit%20online.) to check the uptime of the websites.
